# Principle Component Analysis of feature sets of Pose estimation Data

## Aim -
- To understand optimal number of features that can describe atleast 95% of the variance of the data. 
- Visualize the data in 2D and 3D space to gain insights on the discribability of each category, and similarity between categories
